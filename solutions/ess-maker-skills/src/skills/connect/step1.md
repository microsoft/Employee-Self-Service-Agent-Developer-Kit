# Step 1: Choose an Integration

Every **Message** block is the exact text to show the user. Copy it verbatim.
Do not rephrase, add commentary, or tell the user what tools you are calling.

---

## 1.1 — Check what's already connected

Build a list of connected integrations (if any):

- **ServiceNow** — connected if `.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md` exists and
  all items are checked.
- **Workday** — connected if any of these are true:
  - `.local/connect/workday/config.json` exists and its `setupStatus` shows
    every CEA setup row (`S1.1` … `S6.2`) in state `done` (the CEA setup
    orchestrator owns this state),
  - `.local/connect/workday-da/config.json` exists and its `setupStatus`
    shows every DA row (`DA1.1` … `DA4.1`) in state `done` (the DA Workday
    connect skill owns this state), or
  - `.local/connect/workday/lifecycle.json` exists and every phase is
    `done` (this agent was wired to an extension already installed
    elsewhere — see 1.3 below).

---

## 1.2 — Ask which system

**If PRE_SELECTED_INTEGRATION was passed from SKILL.md** (the user already
specified "servicenow" or "workday"): skip this question entirely. Set the
selection to the pre-selected value and go directly to section 1.3.

If there are connected integrations, show them first:

**Message:**

Currently connected: {list of connected integration names, e.g. "ServiceNow"}

Which system do you want to connect next?

1. **ServiceNow** — IT tickets, HR cases, service catalog
2. **Workday** — Payroll, time off, employee data

**End message.**

If nothing is connected yet:

**Message:**

Which system do you want to connect to your agent?

1. **ServiceNow** — IT tickets, HR cases, service catalog
2. **Workday** — Payroll, time off, employee data

**End message.**

Wait for the user to respond.

## 1.3 — Route by selection

### If the user chose ServiceNow (1 or "servicenow")

Check if `.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md` exists.

**If it exists and all items are checked:**

Read `.local/connect/servicenow/config.json` to get the current `authType`.
Map it to a display name:
- `entra` → "Entra ID (interactive sign-in)"
- `certificate` → "Certificate (service-to-service)"
- `oauth2` → "OAuth2 (ServiceNow credentials)"
- `basic` → "Basic auth"

**Message:**

ServiceNow is already connected using **{display name}**.

1. **Keep current setup** — run `/create` to start building topics
2. **Change authentication** — switch to a different auth method
3. **Reconnect from scratch** — reset everything and start over

**End message.**

Wait for the user.

**If the user chose 1 (keep):** Stop here.

**If the user chose 2 (change auth):**

Use the `vscode_askQuestions` tool:

```json
[
  {
    "header": "Authentication",
    "question": "Which authentication method do you want to switch to?",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Microsoft account (Entra ID)", "description": "Employees use their Microsoft work account" },
      { "label": "Certificate (service-to-service)", "description": "Non-interactive, uses Entra app certificate" },
      { "label": "ServiceNow username and password", "description": "Separate ServiceNow login" },
      { "label": "Dev/test instance", "description": "Simplest setup" }
    ],
    "allowFreeformInput": false
  }
]
```

Map the answer to SNOW_AUTH using the same rules as
`src/skills/connect/servicenow/step1.md` section 1.1 (the per-product
step1, NOT this top-level routing file).

Update `.local/connect/servicenow/config.json` — set `authType` to the new
value. Set `status` to `"in-progress"`. Reset all pack statuses in
`packs` from `"installed"` to `"pending"`.

Update `.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md` — reset steps 2, 3, and 4 from
`- [x]` to `- [ ]`.

Update `.local/config.json` — remove the `connections.ServiceNow` entry (it
will be re-created by step 4 with the new auth type after verification).

**Message:**

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Instance configured | ✅ |
| 2 | Connection secured | ⬜ |
| 3 | Extension installed | ⬜ |
| 4 | Connection verified | ⬜ |

Switching to **{new auth display name}**. Picking up from step 2.

**End message.**

Read `.local/connect/servicenow/config.json` to restore INSTANCE_NAME and
other values. Then route by the new SNOW_AUTH:

- If `entra` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-entra.md`
- If `certificate` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-certificate.md`
- If `oauth2` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-oauth2.md`
- If `federated` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-graph.md`
- If `basic` → mark step 2 complete, read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step3-basic.md`

**If the user chose 3 (reconnect from scratch):**

Reset `.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md` — all steps to `- [ ]`.

Delete `.local/connect/servicenow/config.json`.

Copy `src/skills/connect/servicenow/steps.md` to
`.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md`.

**Message:**

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Instance configured | ⬜ |
| 2 | Connection secured | ⬜ |
| 3 | Extension installed | ⬜ |
| 4 | Connection verified | ⬜ |

Starting fresh. Let's reconnect ServiceNow to your agent.

**End message.**

Now read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step1.md` and follow it.

**If it exists and some items are unchecked:**

Show the checklist from `.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md` (✅ for checked,
⬜ for unchecked) followed by "Picking up where we left off."

Read `.local/connect/servicenow/config.json` to restore saved values
(INSTANCE_NAME, SNOW_USAGE, SNOW_AUTH, etc.). Then find the first unchecked
step and route as follows:

- **Step 1 unchecked** → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step1.md`
- **Step 2 unchecked** → check `authType` in config.json:
  - If `entra` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-entra.md`
  - If `certificate` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-certificate.md`
  - If `oauth2` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-oauth2.md`
  - If `federated` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step2-graph.md`
  - If `basic` → mark step 2 complete, then route to step 3
- **Step 3 unchecked** → check `authType` in config.json:
  - If `entra` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step3-entra.md`
  - If `certificate` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step3-certificate.md`
  - If `oauth2` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step3-oauth2.md`
  - If `federated` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step3-graph.md`
  - If `basic` → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step3-basic.md`
- **Step 4 unchecked** → read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step4.md`

**If it does not exist:**

Copy `src/skills/connect/servicenow/steps.md` to
`.local/connect/servicenow/steps.md`.

**Message:**

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Instance configured | ⬜ |
| 2 | Connection secured | ⬜ |
| 3 | Extension installed | ⬜ |
| 4 | Connection verified | ⬜ |

Let's connect ServiceNow to your agent.

**End message.**

Now read `src/skills/connect/servicenow/step1.md` and follow it.

### If the user chose Workday (2 or "workday")

**If `.local/connect/workday/lifecycle.json` already exists** (this agent was
previously wired to an already-installed extension via 1.3's second path
below): read `src/skills/connect/workday/SKILL.md` and follow it. It
re-verifies everything live before reporting "connected" — it never trusts
the saved state on its own.

**Otherwise**, first find out which kind of ESS agent is in this environment.
Read `.local/setup/config.json` and look at
`selected_products` (each entry is one of `da.esshr` / `da.essit` / `da.esshub`
/ `cea.esshr` / `cea.essit` / `cea.esshub`):

- **No `.local/setup/config.json`, or `selected_products` is empty** — no ESS
  agent has been installed in this environment yet.

  **Message:**

  I don't see an Employee Self-Service agent installed in this environment yet.
  Run `/setup` first, then come back and run `/connect workday` again.

  **End message.**

  Stop here.

**Once an ESS agent is confirmed**, check whether a Workday extension already
exists **anywhere in this environment**, independent of whether this
particular agent has been set up against it yet:

```
python scripts/flightcheck/cli.py --checkpoint WD-PKG-001
```

**If `Passed`:** a Workday extension is already installed in this
environment — this agent likely just needs to be wired to it, not a full
install. Read `src/skills/connect/workday/SKILL.md` and follow it; it shows
the user what it will check before doing anything, and only makes changes
once they confirm.

**If anything other than `Passed`**, route by the installed agent architecture:

- **Any `selected_products` entry starts with `da.`** — read
  `src/skills/setup/workday-da/SKILL.md` and follow it. This path installs the
  Workday extension package, provisions the Workday Entra app, configures the
  Workday tenant, and verifies the connection. It is resume-aware.

- **Otherwise, only `cea.*` entries are present** — read
  `src/skills/setup/SKILL.md` and follow it. This path provisions the Power
  Platform environment, installs the ESS base agent, provisions the Entra app,
  configures the Workday tenant, installs the extension pack, and verifies the
  connection. It is resume-aware.

### If the user said something else

**Message:**

I didn't catch that. Enter **1** for ServiceNow or **2** for Workday.

**End message.**

Wait for the user and try again.
